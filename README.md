# Enterprise-SOC-Threat-Detection-Attack-Simulation-Lab
A hands-on Enterprise SOC lab focused on attack simulation, endpoint monitoring, Splunk-based SIEM analysis, threat detection, incident investigation, and MITRE ATT&amp;CK mapping. Built to demonstrate practical SOC workflows and real-world cybersecurity detection techniques.

# Summary
This project delivered practical experience in building and securing an enterprise-style cybersecurity environment, with a strong focus on attack simulation, detection, and incident analysis. Key areas include:

- **Enterprise Network Setup:** Designed and configured a virtualized network environment for secure communication between systems.
- **Active Directory Security:** Implemented OUs, user accounts, Group Policies, and RBAC to simulate centralized enterprise identity management.
- **Attack Simulation:** Reproduced real-world adversary behaviors using Kali Linux, Crowbar, and Atomic Red Team to generate security events.
- **SOC Monitoring:** Integrated Splunk for centralized log collection, investigation, and detection of suspicious activities.
- **Threat Mapping:** Analyzed attack activity and mapped observed behaviors to relevant **MITRE ATT&CK TTPs**.
- **Incident Investigation:** Investigated security events and correlated endpoint and network logs to identify suspicious behavior and attack patterns.
- **Security Operations:** Applied practical SOC workflows covering monitoring, detection, analysis, and threat investigation.

I started the project by designing a network architecture diagram to visualize the overall lab environment and understand how each system would communicate. The diagram includes the **Active Directory server, Splunk server, Windows 10 target machine, and Kali Linux attacker machine**, along with their respective roles. Planning the architecture beforehand helped me organize the setup, understand the communication flow, and build the environment in a structured way that reflects a real-world enterprise network.
